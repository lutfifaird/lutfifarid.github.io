<p>I started with software engineering and decided to switch my career to data analytic. This is because I want to make bigger impact on society.</p>
<p>While attending uni at <b>UPN "Veteran" Jatim</b>. I was working at the <b>Accounting Software House</b> in Surabaya, starting from making <u>comprehensive accounting reports</u> using SQL. Since the company is based on <i>desktop dev applications</i>, I am quite challenged to be a <i>Lone Wolf</i> to develop a package of <u>site apps</u> and <u>android apps</u> to support dozzen retail accounting in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Today, I am a data analyst at <b>Fore Coffee</b> (Indonesian online-to-offline specialty coffee startup). I am responsible for building datapipeline and analytics. In my spare time, I enjoy sharing my past experiences with an open team and leading them to collaborative projects.</p>
