<p>I love finding growth opportunities in the data, building automation insight solution through programming.</p>
<p>My very first working experience while attending university at night. Between 2013 and 2019, I started working at the Accounting Software House in Surabaya, starting from making comprehensive accounting reports using SQL. 
  Since the company is based on <i>desktop dev applications</i>, I am quite challenged to develop a package of <u>site apps</u> and <u>android apps</u> to support dozzen retail accounting in Indonesia.
  From zero web development team until some.</p>
<p>One year after graduated from bachelor degree at <b>UPN "Veteran" Jatim</b> 2017. 
  I decided to switch my career from software engineer to data analytic. 
  I started learning from
